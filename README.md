🗺️ Topography Image Replicator

A browser-based tool that transforms images into topographic line-art.
Built for experimental visuals, terrain-inspired aesthetics, and procedural design applications.
📦 Project Overview

This project renders image data into topographic line patterns, simulating elevation contours from luminance levels. It’s part of the MythTech visual toolkit but stands alone as a creative utility.
🚀 How It Works

    Upload any image

    Image is converted to grayscale and sampled.

    Each brightness threshold renders a corresponding contour line.

    Output is visualized as a layered SVG/canvas.

🛠️ Features

    🔳 Drag-and-drop or upload image

    📐 Adjustable contour density & resolution

    🎨 Real-time visual preview

    💾 Export topographic output to PNG/SVG

    🧪 Future: heightmap / Godot terrain export support

🧰 Setup

No build tools required.

Just open:

index.html

in a browser.

For local development, use:

npx serve .

🧠 Use Cases

    Game terrain generation

    Concept art & procedural visuals

    3D modeling prep (heightmap reference)

    Artistic data visualization

✨ Roadmap

Godot terrain export (.heightmap, .tres)

Contour animation sweep

Layer blending (multi-channel extraction)

    WebGL rendering for higher performance
